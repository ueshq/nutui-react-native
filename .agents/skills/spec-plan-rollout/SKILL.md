description: >-
  Create spec-first rollout packages for large engineering initiatives: a
  human-readable spec, a phase-and-batch execution plan, and an optional
  generated `rollout.py` runner. Use when Codex needs to orchestrate refactors,
  migrations, convergence work, or cross-system delivery with hard rules,
  verification commands, external dependencies, operational constraints, and
  resumable batches.

# Spec Plan Rollout

Use this skill when the work looks like a real program of delivery rather than a single coding task:

- multi-phase refactors
- architecture convergence
- platform or infrastructure migrations
- cross-repo integrations
- rollouts that mix code changes, docs, verification, and external coordination

This skill can produce two package shapes:

1. Planning package: spec + plan only.
2. Execution package: spec + plan + generated `rollout.py`.

Choose the planning package when the work is still exploratory, heavily approval-driven, or not yet safe for unattended execution. Choose the execution package only when the rollout batches are in-repo, non-interactive, fully automatable, and verifiable.

## Workflow

1. Read these references before drafting:
   - [references/spec-template.md](references/spec-template.md)
   - [references/plan-template.md](references/plan-template.md)
   - [references/orchestration-patterns.md](references/orchestration-patterns.md)

2. Draft a project-specific spec.
   Capture current state, target state, goals, non-goals, principles, technical boundaries, rollout and rollback notes, external dependencies, verification strategy, risks, and definition of done.
   Keep the spec human-readable. It is the planning source, not the runtime source.

3. Draft a project-specific implementation plan.
   Keep prose concise but useful for humans.
   Keep the YAML block between `<!-- rollout-plan:start -->` and `<!-- rollout-plan:end -->` complete and valid because [scripts/generate_rollout.py](scripts/generate_rollout.py) parses that block.
   Model each phase as a milestone and each batch as the smallest end-to-end unit one Codex invocation should finish safely.
   Use prose for rationale, architecture, and coordination notes. Use YAML for anything the runner must obey.

4. Decide whether a runner should be generated.
   Generate a runner only when the plan is stable enough and every runnable batch is local, deterministic, non-interactive, and fully automatable.
   If the initiative is hybrid, keep manual or out-of-repo steps in prose or in an explicit ops checklist. Do not encode them as runner batches.

5. Generate the runner when appropriate:

   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate_rollout.py --plan /path/to/plan.md --output /path/to/rollout.py
   ```

6. Review the generated runner before execution.
   Confirm `repo_root`, `workdir`, `sources_of_truth`, planning notes, hard rules, and batch verification commands.
   Prefer short, idempotent verify commands.
   Use batch-local verification whenever possible.
   Confirm that no batch depends on hidden manual work and that the full execution path is automatable end to end.

7. Execute or resume the rollout:

   ```bash
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py --list
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py --from-phase 02-contract
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py --from-batch 02-02-handlers
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py --only-batch 03-01-tests
   python3 /path/to/rollout.py --dry-run
   ```

## Planning Rules

- Keep phases coarse and batches fine. A phase is a milestone. A batch is one safe work packet.
- Give every phase and batch a stable numeric prefix such as `01-foundation` or `02-03-api-client`.
- Start with current-state evidence. For plan-heavy work, the spec should say what exists today, what is broken, and how progress will be measured.
- Separate three kinds of work clearly:
  - in-repo changes Codex can perform
  - read-only references in sibling repos or external systems
  - manual or external actions that require people, cloud consoles, or approvals, which stay outside the generated runner
- Put the most important constraints in `hard_rules`. They are injected into every batch prompt.
- Put batch-specific constraints, deliverables, and acceptance inside the batch.
- Prefer an explicit baseline or foundation phase before bulk migration phases.
- Every phase should state entry criteria, exit criteria, and top risks when the initiative is large enough to need them.
- Use `batch.depends_on` when simple phase ordering is not enough.
- Use `batch.kind` to signal the work shape such as `analysis`, `code`, `docs`, or `verification`.
- Keep `execution` set to `codex`; the generated runner is fully automatic and does not support manual pause points.
- Keep verify commands non-interactive and deterministic.
- Keep external checkpoints evidence-oriented in prose or checklist form so humans can execute them outside the runner.
- Make later batches depend on earlier work by ordering them in the same phase. Use explicit dependencies only when needed.
- Do not ask the runner to infer the plan from prose. The YAML block is authoritative.

## When To Split

Split a new batch when any of these are true:

- The work touches more than one subsystem and can be verified separately.
- The prompt would require multiple distinct acceptance checkpoints.
- A failed verification should not force rerunning unrelated work.
- You would want an isolated commit boundary.

## When Not To Generate A Runner

Skip runner generation for now when any of these are true:

- Most work is still discovery, decision-making, or stakeholder alignment.
- Success depends on many manual cloud or vendor actions.
- Verification is mostly human judgment and not yet scriptable.
- The plan shape is expected to change daily while the design is still moving.

## Runner Behavior

The generated `rollout.py`:

- persists progress in a state file under the configured workdir
- writes batch prompts and logs under the configured workdir
- calls `codex exec ... -` for each batch
- verifies each batch with shell commands
- feeds failed verification output back into a retry prompt
- runs only fully automated batches and rejects manual pause points at generation time
- resumes from unfinished work
- supports phase and batch selection flags
