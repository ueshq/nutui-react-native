# <Initiative Name> Implementation Plan

This document has two layers:

- prose for humans
- a machine-readable YAML block used by `scripts/generate_rollout.py`

If prose and YAML disagree, the YAML block wins.

## Planning Heuristics

- One phase = one milestone.
- One batch = one Codex invocation worth of end-to-end work.
- Prefer 2-6 batches per phase.
- Prefer local verification commands for runnable batches.
- Order batches exactly as they should run.
- Use prose for rationale and coordination.
- Use YAML for anything the runner must obey.
- Model manual or out-of-repo checkpoints explicitly in prose or an external checklist instead of hiding them in runner batches.

## Field Notes

- `rollout.repo_root`: Prefer an absolute path because the generated `rollout.py` is standalone.
- `rollout.workdir`: Relative paths are resolved from `repo_root`.
- `rollout.sources_of_truth`: Injected into every batch prompt.
- `rollout.planning_notes`: Shared planning context such as baseline metrics, migration shape, or cross-team constraints.
- `rollout.success_metrics`: Reminders about what the initiative must measurably improve or preserve.
- `rollout.global_context`: Shared context injected into every batch prompt.
- `rollout.hard_rules`: Non-negotiable rules injected into every batch prompt.
- `rollout.batch_prompt_suffix`: Common closing reminders appended to every batch prompt.
- `phase.summary`: Optional context shared by all batches in that phase.
- `phase.entry_criteria` / `phase.exit_criteria`: Use these for complex migrations or convergence work where gating matters.
- `phase.risks`: Short list of the main things that could invalidate the plan.
- `batch.kind`: Freeform label such as `analysis`, `code`, `docs`, or `verification`.
- `batch.execution`: Keep this as `codex`. The generated runner is fully automatic and does not support manual pause points.
- `batch.depends_on`: Optional extra dependencies on specific batch ids. Batch order is still authoritative.
- `batch.evidence_to_capture`: Evidence that should exist when the batch is complete.
- `batch.files_to_touch`: Optional hint list. It does not restrict the runner.
- `batch.prompt_context`: Optional batch-only notes.

## Authoring Checklist

- Use stable, numeric IDs such as `01-foundation` and `01-02-api`.
- Make batch goals action-oriented and end-to-end.
- Keep verification commands small, deterministic, and non-interactive for runnable batches.
- Do not let one batch depend on work from a later batch.
- Add an explicit baseline phase when the initiative depends on inventories or current-state scans.
- Separate repo work from external or manual work.
- Keep non-automated work in prose or an external checklist, not in the generated runner's YAML batches.
- If a batch would be painful to rerun after a failed verify step, split it.
